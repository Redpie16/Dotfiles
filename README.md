# Personal Dotfiles for just about everything 
*Termux included* 

## Setup Instructions
1) go to the folder location at base of the dotfiles
2) run the script with the appropriate inputs
  1) the first input is either  ***desktop*** or ***termux*** and it pulls the correct nvim config for either
  2) the next input is only for *desktop* and specifies which if any or all wm configs you want to pull *currently only Wayfire and Hyperland*
     * leaving this input blank loads none
     * possible options are *wf*, *hypr* and *all*
